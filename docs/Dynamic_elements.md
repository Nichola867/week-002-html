# Dynamic elements of My To Do List Website:

- *Task number* - increases or decreases when task are added/removed
    - consideration of what happens to this if the task list extends beyond the page, does this remain in place or do you need to scroll up to view it?

- *Task section* - changes when adding tasks to it
    - consideration of how tasks are listed and what happens to a task if the one above gets deleted.
    - what happens if the task is long, what happens to the buttons? Will the field extend vertically rather than horizontally
    
- *Free type task field* - to reset once the task has been added    
     - would it be possible to add an empty task?
     - could something be written in the free type field that might cause issues with the database or the coding beneath the website?
